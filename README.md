## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!

Iâ€™m Fabi-RG!
Iâ€™m someone who loves exploring, learning, and occasionally just messing around with ideas. Coding is one of my side hobbies, and I enjoy diving into it whenever I have the chance. ðŸ˜„

## ðŸŒŸ A Bit About Me
ðŸŸ¢ I love spending my free time learnig all kinds of new things.
ðŸŽ¸ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you might find me playing guitar, experimenting with sounds, or recording some tracks.

## ðŸ’» My Coding Journey
I started coding when I was 14, during a class where we learned the basics of C and HTML. It was all very simple, and I was mostly just experimenting, but it really caught my attention. No one else in the class seemed to be as interested in it as I was, which made me enjoy it even more.
Since then, Iâ€™ve been tinkering with code for a few years. Right now, I spend some of my free time experimenting with different ideas, figuring out how things work, building small projects, and just enjoying the process. For me, itâ€™s all about learning. Some topics I find especially fascinating are:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Creative Coding: Creating art and music through code? Absolutely! ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽµ
